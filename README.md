# REU2021
This summer, I am participating in an REU program at the College of Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State University. Specifically, I am working on research regarding the identification of unsafe code on Rust. The goal is to build a machine learning model that will help accomplish this. My first step will be to apply objdump to binary files and save this output to word files. To accomplish this, I will begin working on a machine that will be able to parse input files. Because we have converted the source code into binary code, we will be able to identify any unsafe code. My mentor for this project is Professor Linhai Song.
